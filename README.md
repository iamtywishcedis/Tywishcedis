# Tywishcedis
Frank is my name and am from Africa, a country called Ghana. Most my friends in my town called me nicknames like Mellow Cedis, Tywish and Big Joe. Am also jovial,calm,zany and like to discover and explore, it many but a few to say.  I was born in a city called Agona Swedru, In the Central Region of Ghana. I like making friends but a good friend, not bad friends. A friend is one who overlooks your broken fence and admires the flowers in your garden.” “A good friend is like a four-leaf clover: hard to find and fortunate to have.” “There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends.” "True friendship comes when the silence between two people is comfortable. My passion is becoming a "Good Doctor" in the future. "Becoming a doctor is not easy. As a medical student you are always busy with lectures, practical, essays, labs and endless work.  You work a lot more than other people and don’t have as much time for holidays or vacations. It is a long path with a massive pay off at the end – you get to help others and contribute to society! But the journey is difficult and challenging. And you might face dark times and question your path. It all start with supporting and donating to my aid in Ghana. Are you ready to help some people in Ghana like me.
